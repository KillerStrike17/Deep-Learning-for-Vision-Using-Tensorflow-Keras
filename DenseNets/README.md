Using the created [API](https://github.com/prateekgulati/rgApi), i am converting the data to TFRecords and feeding to DenseNet. 

I have also implemented OneCycle LR policy to cross the target Accuracy of 80%.

## Results

Crossed 80% in 13 Epochs.

Max Accuracy Achieved in Epochs: 48

Max Accuracy Reached: 87.16
