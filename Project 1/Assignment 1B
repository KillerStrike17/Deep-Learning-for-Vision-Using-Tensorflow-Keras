Question 3: How many times do we need to perform 3x3 convolution operation to reach 1x1 from 199x199 (show calculations)?
Solution:
Every time there is a convolution with 3x3 matrix the size of the input matrix reduces by 2 i.e. here after first convolution operation the matrix will be 197x197. And then after one more operation it will reduce to 195x 195.
we here can see a pattern i.e. the series is in arithematic progression with a common difference 2, the first element is 197 and the last is 1. So we can calculate the total number of layers needed using the formulae an = a +(n-1)xd. Where an is 1, a is 197, d is -2 as the series is in decreasing order and we need to find n
