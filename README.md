# Deep Learning in Vision using Tensorflow & Keras

This repository is about applied Deep Learning concepts in the domain of vision from the basics. 

### [Understanding the Kernels](/1. Kernels)

This will give a brief idea on what is a kernel, what is its job and how to write custom kernels. 

### [Concept of Receptive Fields in DNNs](./2. Global and Local Receptive Fields/README.md)

This will lead to understand and calculate local and global receptive fields. 

### [Develop First DNN](/3. First-Deep-Neural-Network with kernel Visualization)

This contains vanilla code to develop your first Deep Neural Network Model over [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The notebook shared also contains the code to view the applied filters over to different layers.

### [Coding Drill](/4. 99.4-Accuracy-under-15k-Parameters in MNIST)

This will guide you on how to improve your vanilla network over accuracy achieved and the size of model. 

### [Regularization](/5. Image Normalization-L2-regularization)

Reduce overfitting by L2 regularization Techniques. The folder also has a code to obtain misclassified images, which will help in understanding where the model is failing.

### [Types of Convolutions](/6. Types-of-Convolutions)

There are various types of Convolution layers available, The Notebooks will contains its implementation on how to use them. This notebook is just to show how to integrate it with your model.
